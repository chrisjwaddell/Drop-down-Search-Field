do I put this in a library like dom.js?
see scroll-out

-----------------

^Drop down option

show on empty



-----------------

^Code structure

work out why scroll-out starts how it does

I'm looking at some code of a well writen library and it starts this way. var LibraryName = (function () { .... }   rather than  -  const LibraryName = { .... }.   Why?


functions have closure, objects don't. but if i do var LibraryName = (function () { .... }   rather than  -  function LibraryName{ .... }. Why do libraries do the function expresssion with IIFE rather than a straight function?


how should i structure country list?
I should have render and bindEvents in my countrylist and maybe put it in an IIFE
as it is now vs Revealing module pattern??

cache dom
bindEvents
render()

all pretty standard

methods should be in a prototype



"use strict"



-----------------

search for "field component" in github

Description
How to use



Description
Like Google.com search bar
It is a field that contains a list of possible options but without a drop down arrow. You type and it automatically suggests possibilities from the list based on first letter or a combination of letters that match the list items.

Like google.com search field
It takes an array of options


/*  This drop down is like google.com
 *  The user can use up or down arrows or the mouse to select items
 *  Up and down arrows change the text in the text
 *  box but move hover doesn't  change the text field value
 *  Hovering over a list item, then using the arrows takes out the hover effect
 *  It doesn't use CSS hover because I have more control with mousemove
 *  when working with together with keypresses
 */


/*
 * Focus is the only event that's always on, it triggers the start of keyup and blur events
 * The functions are the same name as the event eg blur, mouseMove, focus
 * with the exception of escape
 * The DOM holds all the information, no global vars are used
 */

Animated gifs

First - what is it?
animated png
type in 'ind', show each frame
i, in, ind

hover over drop down   - text caption saying mouse hover
escape hit - text goes back - text caption saying esc hit



2) How to put it in
text/code
id="dropdownsearch1"
js - xxxxx("#dropdownsearch1",...., ["Mathew", "Mark", "Luke", "John"])
- or have country list in, or state list in code as a var - const states = ["Arizona", ..... ]
show drop down
animation of how to put it in

type a letter
type 3 it finds these 3 letters anywhere
type a letter, use down up arrows, use mouse


------------

Have 2 vars for 2 boxes
if Aus - select state - "South Australia, Western Australia"
If USA - Arizona etc

Have this as my codepen and my github page



How to use

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./dropdown-search-field.css">


1) option to create the field - give it area to put it in
2) cut and paste the html code into your html, give it an id
* show these 2 options later in readme.md, show the animated png first




*************************************************************************


Make a Gitpage for it
with country list

field at top, list appears below - "Country list - list appears below"
field at bottom of screen, list appears above - "Country list - list appears above"


setting the list to something else will only be done in custom cloud db


pictures when I type in
'str' -> Australia
- 3 letters
S -> ....


Country, make as a codepen
Put into custom cloud db



************************************************************************************************************************************

Maybe do the below in the next version


**************************************************************************************

show list at top of field or at the bottom?
what if list goes over the size? maybe put fake data in so S has 40 countries, can I use arrow keys to see all?


<div class="field">
	<label>Country of birth</label>
	<input type="text" placeholder="Country of birth" autofocus="" aria-autocomplete="both" autocapitalize="none" autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" spellcheck="false" value="">
	<ul class="countrylist"></ul>
</div>

class field , add datalist


Google Keep doesn't care

do I need debounce?

Build an Autocomplete Input with Debounce

https://www.wix.com/velo/forum/coding-with-velo/how-to-combine-dropdown-menus-with-a-search-bar-solved
- this has debounce

Google doesn't appear to use debounce. It's best when there is something hefty to look up. The request is loaded and takes a few seconds to get an answer back. When it's really fast to respond, I don't need debounce
I think that's the case, just work this out first
* lessons

if they type one letter, look it up immediately but if they type a 2nd .....
maybe 1s pause before doing anything

************************************************************************************************************************************


If it is on search, it can be
one selection only drop down list
list - only one selection allowed/mult selections allowed
OR for mult selection, it will match with items that have one of these values
